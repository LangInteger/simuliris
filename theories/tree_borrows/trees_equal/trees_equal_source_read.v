  (* Remember that the entire reason we have [trees_equal] in the first place
     is to enable spurious reads. This is the lemma that verifies that after we
     do a spurious read we get a [tree_equal].
     Specifically, it is for source-only spurious reads.
     This means we do not need to prove they succeed, we _get_ this as an assumption.
     All that is necessary in addition is showing that equality is preserved.

     The resulting direction is backwards because we later use the transitivity that has
       new_source =Forwards= old_source =Forwards= old_target,
     but the lemma is stated as old_source =Backwards= new_source for mostly historical reasons
     and laziness.
